Type of keys
"""
Primary key:
	it is a col val which uniquely identifies each record in a table
	cannot be null.
	Eg: customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
	Here customer_id col val uniquely identifies each customer.

Foreign key:
	used to  establish a relationship between 2 tables.
	Eg:  CREATE TABLE Orders (
		customer_id INT REFERENCES Customers(customer_id));

	means customer_id in Orders table must match with any customer_id in Customer Table
	this ensures that only registered Customers can make Orders.


Unique Key:
	used to ensure that column has unique values in a table.
	But it can be null.
	Eg: email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
	    email value must be unique.

Candidate Key:
	a column or minimal set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
	cannot be null so can be used as primary key.
	Eg:	CREATE TABLE Customers (
  		customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  		first_name VARCHAR(50),
  		last_name VARCHAR(50),
  		email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
		);
	Here both customer_id and email are candidate keys.


Composite Key:
	set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
	Eg: 	customer_id INT,
  		order_date DATE,
  		total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
		UNIQUE (customer_id, order_date)

		Here combination of (customer_id, order_date) cols uniquely identifies
		each record in a table.

Super Key:
	a set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
	may contain extra columns compared to candidate key.
	a minimal superkey is a candidate key.


Surrogate Key:
	an artificially created primary key(often using an auto-incrementing integer value).
	Eg: order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
		The "SERIAL" data type is a special type in PostgreSQL that is an auto-incrementing integer.
		It automatically generates a unique integer value for each new row inserted into the table. 

Alternate Key:
	a candidate key that is not selected as the primary key.
	Eg:	CREATE TABLE Customers (
  		customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  		first_name VARCHAR(50),
  		last_name VARCHAR(50),
  		email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
		);

		Here email is alternate key as it is not used as primary key.
